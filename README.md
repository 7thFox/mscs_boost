Bootsstrap and Boosted Models Framework
=======================================

This repository's template was created for MSCS-335/535 (Machine Learning).

The code is a self-contained Python module, that depends on NumPy, SciPy, and SKLearn.
It included the (incomplete) classes:
 - BoostedRegressor
 - BoostedClassifier

Classes were completed my myself as a part of the course.
